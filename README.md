HTML5_Design
============

The HTML 5 design project was something that I thought of to do the following:
1. Learn HTML 5
2. Use some kind of animation.
3. Have a refrence on the web for UI design
  - What? => I am reading a book on UI design patterns and the how and when to use it.  I want to take the ideas in the book and rewrite them in my own words and have examples on how/when to use them.  Also some sites that currently use those patterns.
